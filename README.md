# About Me:

👋 Hi, I'm Graham!

👩‍💻 I'm a dedicated professional passionate about front-end development, specializing in technologies like React, Redux, and JavaScript. My journey in this field has led me to create various projects, ranging from a full-stack Film Catalog app for tracking camera settings in film photography to user-friendly web apps tailored for board games like Monopoly Money and Catan Calculator.

🌱 My commitment to continuous learning extends beyond my primary areas of expertise. I've ventured into diverse domains, exploring Node.js, SQL, C, and Cyber Security, all part of my pursuit of growth and knowledge.

🎓 My educational foundation includes a B.A. degree in music from the University of Lethbridge and a Music Diploma in percussion from Red Deer Polytechnic. These academic experiences have instilled invaluable skills such as effective time management, project coordination, and adept teamwork.
